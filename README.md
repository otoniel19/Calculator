# Calculator
A calculator written in JavaScript, a little advanced, that supports operations beyond addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, como:
  Power: (^)
  Square root: (√)
  Percentage: (%)
  Factorial: (!)

Additionally, it also supports other things such as:
  - Multiplication of roots (example: 3√9 = 9)
  - Resolution of expressions that have parentheses in front of them and in front of the expression there is no operator (example: 5(7 + 3) = 50)
